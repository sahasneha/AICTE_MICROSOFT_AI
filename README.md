# AI-Powered Used Car Classifier 🚗

This project uses supervised machine learning techniques to classify used cars based on multiple features such as price, age, mileage, fuel type, and ownership. The goal is to support better decision-making for buyers and sellers in the used car market.

## 📌 Problem Statement
Evaluating the true condition or value category of a pre-owned car is challenging. This project builds an AI-based model to classify cars into quality/price categories using data-driven analysis.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📊 Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Feature Engineering
- Classification with Random Forest
- Model Evaluation using Accuracy, Confusion Matrix
- Visualizations (Feature Importance, Countplots, etc.)

## 🧠 How It Works
1. Load the dataset
2. Preprocess and encode features
3. Split into train and test sets
4. Train a classifier (Random Forest)
5. Evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall
6. Visualize results

## ▶️ Running Instructions
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/used-car-classifier.git
cd used-car-classifier
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook

## 🔮 Future Scope
- Integration with web frontend using Streamlit
- API for real-time predictions
- Include car service history and resale trends
